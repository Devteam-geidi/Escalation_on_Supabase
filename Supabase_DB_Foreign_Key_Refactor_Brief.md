# 🚀 Supabase DB Optimization Brief: Foreign Keys & Joins

**Prepared by:** Paul  
**Based on recommendations by:** John  
**Audience:** Junior Devs working on Supabase DBs  
**Goal:** Help you understand **why** we should use foreign keys with integers and **how** to refactor our schema accordingly.

## 🧠 Why This Matters

### 1. **Performance**
- **Integer joins are faster**: Comparing integers is quicker than strings (O(1) vs O(n)).
- **Lower CPU load**: Your queries run more efficiently, especially under scale.
- **Supabase compute costs** stay down.

### 2. **Data Integrity**
- Using **foreign key constraints** helps prevent orphaned rows and enforces proper relationships between tables.

### 3. **Maintainability**
- Queries are easier to write, understand, and refactor.
- Ensures standardization across all modules and teams.

## ❌ Problem in Current Setup

- Some tables are **joined using `varchar` fields** (e.g., codes, slugs, UUIDs).
- This slows down queries **as your data volume grows**.
- Queries will **loop through characters** instead of comparing simple integers.

---

## ✅ Best Practice to Fix It

### Step 1: Add Integer Primary Keys
- For every core entity table (e.g., `users`, `products`, `categories`), ensure you have:
  ```sql
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY
  ```

### Step 2: Use Foreign Keys on Integer Columns
- In child or transactional tables, store the **integer `id`**, not a string reference.
  ```sql
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id)
  ```

### Step 3: Refactor Queries
- Update all JOINs:
  ```sql
  -- ❌ Avoid this
  JOIN users ON transactions.username = users.username

  -- ✅ Do this
  JOIN users ON transactions.user_id = users.id
  ```

### Step 4: Update Supabase Relationships
- In the Supabase dashboard, define relationships using the **integer keys** so you get:
  - Auto-generated filters
  - Relationship-aware APIs

## 🧪 Final Checklist

✅ Integer `id` used for joins  
✅ Foreign key constraints declared  
✅ Queries updated to use integer IDs  
✅ Transaction tables contain only foreign keys + event fields  
✅ Supabase relationships configured

## 📌 Example: Transaction Table Design

```sql
CREATE TABLE transactions (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  user_id INTEGER REFERENCES users(id),
  product_id INTEGER REFERENCES products(id),
  transaction_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT now()
);
```

Display logic can still fetch everything needed by joining with `users`, `products`, etc.

## 🔁 Rollout Strategy

1. Refactor in development.
2. Migrate data (create new columns if needed, backfill with joined integer IDs).
3. Deploy after QA.
4. Remove old varchar join fields **after validation**.

Keep it clean. Keep it fast. Scale smart.
