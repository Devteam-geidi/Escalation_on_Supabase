# Schema Versioning Best Practices Guide
*A staged approach to database schema management for production systems*

---

## Why This Matters: The Change Agenda

### Without Schema Versioning vs. With Schema Versioning

| Aspect                | **Without** (Current UI/Console Approach)         | **With** (Schema Files + Git)                         |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------- |
| **Change Tracking**   | ❌ No history of who changed what, when            | ✅ Full Git history with author, timestamp, and reason |
| **Collaboration**     | ❌ Team members can overwrite each other's changes | ✅ Code review process prevents conflicts              |
| **Rollbacks**         | ❌ Manual recreation, often impossible             | ✅ Clean rollback to any previous version              |
| **Testing**           | ❌ Changes go straight to production               | ✅ Test in staging before production                   |
| **Documentation**     | ❌ Changes undocumented or in scattered notes      | ✅ Self-documenting through commit messages            |
| **Onboarding**        | ❌ New team members learn by trial and error       | ✅ Clear process and history to learn from             |
| **Debugging**         | ❌ "Why does this table exist?" mysteries          | ✅ Clear context for every schema decision             |
| **Production Safety** | ❌ High risk of breaking changes                   | ✅ Validated changes with clear deployment process     |
| **Compliance**        | ❌ Difficult to audit changes                      | ✅ Full audit trail for compliance                     |

### Key Benefits
- **Reliability**: Reduce production incidents by 80%+
- **Collaboration**: Multiple developers can work safely on schema changes
- **Confidence**: Know exactly what changed and why
- **Speed**: Faster debugging and onboarding
- **Scalability**: Process scales with team growth

## Staged Learning Plan

### Stage 0: Foundation Understanding
**Goal**: Build confidence with SQL and understand the current state  
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks (2-4 hours/week)  
**Prerequisites**: Basic SQL knowledge, Git familiarity

#### Tasks:
1. **Schema Audit**
   - Export current Supabase schema using `supabase db dump`
   - Review all tables, relationships, and constraints
   - Document any "mystery" tables or columns

2. **Practice Safe Changes**
   - Make a small, non-critical change in Supabase UI
   - Export schema again and see the difference
   - Understand how UI changes translate to SQL

3. **Learning Resources**
   - **SQLBolt** (sqlbolt.com) - Interactive SQL exercises, focus on lessons 13-18 (table management)
   - **Supabase Schema Docs** (supabase.com/docs/guides/database/tables) - Official schema management guide
   - **PostgreSQL Tutorial** (postgresqltutorial.com) - Sections on DDL, constraints, and indexes
   - **"Learning SQL" by Alan Beaulieu** - Chapters 2-3 for solid foundations
   - **PostgreSQL Documentation** (postgresql.org/docs/current/ddl.html) - Data Definition Language reference

4. **Discover `supabase db diff`**
   - Make a small change in Supabase UI (add a comment to a table)
   - Run `supabase db diff` to see the generated SQL
   - **Key insight**: This shows the connection between UI actions and SQL code
   - Practice this several times to demystify the process

#### Success Criteria:
- Can explain current schema structure
- Comfortable reading and writing basic SQL DDL
- Understands difference between DDL and DML

---

### Stage 1: Move to SQL Files
**Goal**: Stop using UI for schema changes, use SQL files + Git  
**Effort**: 1-2 weeks (4-6 hours/week)  
**Risk Level**: Low (working in development)

#### Setup Tasks:
1. **Create Schema Repository Structure in Git**
   ```
   /db
   ├── schema/
   │   ├── 001_initial_schema.sql
   │   └── README.md
   ├── migrations/
   │   ├── schema/          # Structure changes
   │   └── data/           # Data migrations
   ├── seeds/
   ├── tests/              # pgTAP tests
   └── templates/          # Migration templates
   ```

2. **Establish Naming Convention**
   - Format: `YYYY-MM-DD-HH-MM-JIRA-KEY-description.sql`
   - Example: `2025-07-07-14-30-DB-123-add-user-profiles-table.sql`
   - Always include JIRA ticket number for traceability

3. **Rollback Safety & Testing**
   ```sql
   -- Test rollback procedure in staging
   BEGIN;
   -- Apply migration
   CREATE TABLE test_table (id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY);
   -- Test rollback
   DROP TABLE test_table CASCADE;
   ROLLBACK; -- Practice the rollback
   ```

#### Migration Classification:
- **Reversible**: Can be safely rolled back (ADD COLUMN, CREATE INDEX)
- **Irreversible**: Cannot be undone without data loss (DROP COLUMN, DROP TABLE)
- **Complex**: Requires data migration or multiple steps

#### Testing Rollbacks:
- Always test rollback procedures in staging
- Document any data loss implications
- Use `CASCADE` appropriately in rollback statements
- Verify dependent objects after rollback

#### Best Practices to Learn:
- **Always use transactions** for complex changes
- **Include rollback statements** as comments
- **Test before committing**
- **One logical change per file**
- **Link to JIRA tickets** in commit messages and migration comments

#### JIRA Integration:
Every database change should have a corresponding JIRA ticket:
- **Ticket Type**: "Task" or "Story" depending on scope
- **Summary Format**: "DB: [Brief description]" (e.g., "DB: Add user profile tables")
- **Components**: Add "Database" component if available
- **Description Template**:
  ```
  ## Database Change Request
  
  **What**: Brief description of the change
  **Why**: Business justification
  **Impact**: What tables/data affected
  **Rollback Plan**: How to undo if needed
  **Testing**: How change will be validated
  
  ## Acceptance Criteria
  - [ ] Migration created and tested locally
  - [ ] Applied successfully in staging
  - [ ] No performance degradation
  - [ ] Documentation updated
  ```

#### Git Commit Message Format:
```
[DB-123] Add user profiles table

- Add user_profiles table with email, name, avatar fields
- Add foreign key constraint to auth.users
- Include unique constraint on email field

Related: DB-123
```

#### Learning Resources:
- **"Database Design for Mere Mortals" by Michael Hernandez** - Excellent for understanding schema design principles
- **Supabase CLI Documentation** (supabase.com/docs/reference/cli) - Complete CLI reference
- **PostgreSQL DDL Best Practices** (wiki.postgresql.org/wiki/Don%27t_Do_This) - Common mistakes to avoid
- **Git for Database Changes** (thoughtbot.com/blog/database-migrations) - Thoughtbot's excellent guide
- **"Refactoring Databases" by Scott Ambler** - Advanced techniques for schema evolution

#### Success Criteria:
- All new schema changes go through SQL files
- Comfortable with basic DDL operations
- Can create and apply simple migrations

---

### Stage 2: Adopt Migration Tools
**Goal**: Introduce structure and automation  
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks (6-8 hours/week)  
**Risk Level**: Medium (touching production process)

#### Tool Selection:
For Supabase, I recommend **Supabase CLI** as it's native and well-integrated:

```bash
# Install Supabase CLI
npm install -g supabase

# Initialize project
supabase init

# Create new migration
supabase migration new add_user_profiles

# Apply migration
supabase db push
```

#### Key Commands to Master:
- `supabase db diff` - Compare local vs remote
- `supabase db push` - Apply migrations
- `supabase db reset` - Reset local database
- `supabase migration new` - Create new migration

#### Advanced Techniques:
1. **Schema Diffing**
   - Always run `supabase db diff` before creating migrations
   - Review changes carefully before applying

2. **Beyond Tables: Complete Schema Management**
   Supabase migrations should include ALL schema objects, not just tables:
   
   **Row-Level Security (RLS) Policies:**
   ```sql
   -- RLS policies are critical security components
   CREATE POLICY "Users can view own profile" ON user_profiles
   FOR SELECT USING (auth.uid() = user_id);
   ```
   
   **Database Functions & Triggers:**
   ```sql
   -- Custom functions for business logic
   CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_updated_at_column()
   RETURNS TRIGGER AS $
   BEGIN
       NEW.updated_at = NOW();
       RETURN NEW;
   END;
   $ language 'plpgsql';
   ```
   
   **Storage Policies:**
   ```sql
   -- Supabase Storage access policies
   CREATE POLICY "Users can upload own avatars" ON storage.objects
   FOR INSERT WITH CHECK (bucket_id = 'avatars' AND auth.uid()::text = (storage.foldername(name))[1]);
   ```

3. **Transaction Safety**
   ```sql
   BEGIN;
   
   -- Your changes here
   ALTER TABLE users ADD COLUMN email_verified BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE;
   
   -- Test the change
   SELECT * FROM users LIMIT 1;
   
   COMMIT; -- or ROLLBACK if issues
   ```

4. **Rollback Planning**
   - Document rollback steps in migration comments
   - Test rollback procedures in staging

#### Success Criteria:
- Can create, test, and apply migrations using CLI
- Understands migration state management
- Can safely rollback changes

#### Learning Resources:
- **Supabase Migration Guide** (supabase.com/docs/guides/cli/local-development) - Official migration workflow
- **"Database Migrations Done Right" by Brandur Leach** (brandur.org/migrations) - Excellent deep-dive article
- **PostgreSQL Migration Patterns** (postgres.cz/wiki/PostgreSQL_SQL_Tricks_III) - Advanced migration techniques
- **"Zero Downtime Database Migrations" by Gojko Adzic** - Free online article about safe deployments
- **Migration Testing with pgTAP** (pgtap.org) - Testing framework for database changes
- **pgTAP Tutorial** (pgtap.org/documentation.html) - Getting started with database testing

#### Schema Testing Introduction (Advanced Goal):
**Note**: pgTAP testing is the most challenging part of this stage. Consider it an advanced goal for Stage 2 and a core requirement for later stages.

```sql
-- Example pgTAP tests (when ready for advanced techniques)
SELECT has_table('user_profiles');
SELECT has_column('user_profiles', 'email');
SELECT col_has_default('user_profiles', 'created_at');
SELECT col_is_unique('user_profiles', 'email');
SELECT fk_ok('user_profiles', 'user_id', 'auth', 'users', 'id');
```

Basic testing checklist for each migration (start simple):
- [ ] Table/column exists as expected
- [ ] Constraints are properly applied
- [ ] Indexes are created and functional
- [ ] Foreign key relationships work
- [ ] Default values populate correctly

**Consider**: pgTAP could become its own stage (Stage 2.5 or Stage 6) once the team is comfortable with basic migrations.

### Stage 3: Staging + CI/CD Integration
**Goal**: Safe promotion from development to production  
**Effort**: 2-3 weeks (6-10 hours/week)  
**Risk Level**: Medium-High (production safety)

#### Environment Setup:
1. **Staging Environment**
   - Separate Supabase project for staging
   - Copy production data (anonymized) to staging
   - Test all changes in staging first

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   ```yaml
   # .github/workflows/schema-check.yml
   name: Schema Validation
   on:
     pull_request:
       paths:
         - 'db/**'
   
   jobs:
     validate:
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest
       steps:
         - uses: actions/checkout@v3
         - name: Setup Supabase CLI
           uses: supabase/setup-cli@v1
         - name: Validate migrations
           run: supabase db diff
   ```

#### Production Deployment Process:
1. **JIRA Ticket** → Create database change request
2. **Development** → Create migration locally, link to ticket
3. **Code Review** → Team reviews SQL changes and JIRA ticket
4. **Staging** → Apply and test migration, update ticket
5. **Production** → Apply migration during maintenance window
6. **Verification** → Confirm success, close JIRA ticket

#### JIRA Workflow Integration:
- **To Do** → Ticket created, requirements defined
- **In Progress** → Migration being developed locally
- **Code Review** → PR created with migration file
- **Testing** → Migration applied to staging
- **Ready for Production** → Staging tests passed
- **Done** → Successfully deployed to production

#### Safety Measures:
- **Required approvals** for schema changes
- **Backup before major changes**
- **Rollback plan** documented and tested
- **Monitoring** after deployment
- **Post-deployment verification** checklist

#### Post-Deployment Observability:
Monitor these after each deployment:
- **Supabase Dashboard**: Check for performance degradation
- **Error Logs**: Monitor for constraint violations or query failures
- **Data Validation**: 
  ```sql
  -- Example post-deployment checks
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM new_table; -- Expected row count
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM users WHERE email_verified IS NULL; -- Data distribution
  SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname FROM pg_indexes WHERE tablename = 'new_table'; -- Indexes created
  ```
- **Performance Metrics**: Query execution times, connection counts
- **Application Health**: Ensure dependent services still function

#### Success Criteria:
- All schema changes go through staging first
- Automated validation in CI/CD
- Clear deployment process documented

        run: |
          for file in db/migrations/**/*.sql; do
            echo "Validating $file"
            # Basic SQL syntax check
            psql --set ON_ERROR_STOP=1 -f "$file" postgres://dummy
          done
      - name: Check migration naming
        run: |
          # Verify JIRA ticket format in filenames

### Repository Structure Best Practices

For larger teams, consider separating concerns:

**Monorepo Approach** (Recommended for smaller teams):
```
/your-app
├── /src (application code)
├── /db (database schemas)
└── /docs
```

**Split Repository Approach** (For larger teams):
```
/app-database-schemas (separate repo)
├── /migrations
├── /seeds  
├── /tests
└── /docs

/your-main-app (main repo)
├── /src
└── /docs
```

### Migration Template Generator Script
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# create-migration.sh
JIRA_KEY=$1
DESCRIPTION=$2
TIMESTAMP=$(date +%Y-%m-%d-%H-%M)
FILENAME="${TIMESTAMP}-${JIRA_KEY}-${DESCRIPTION}.sql"
